 step 1.-->    first  need to install  npm install --save @react-native-firebase/app
step2.-->     need to  install  npm install --save @react-native-firebase/auth

If you're developing your app using iOS, run this command
cd ios/ && pod install

On the Firebase console, add a new Android application and enter your projects details. The "Android package name" must match your local projects package name which can be found inside of the manifest tag within the /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file within your project.
e.g -' com.otpverification'
The debug signing certificate is optional to use Firebase with your app, but is required for Dynamic Links, Invites and Phone Authentication. To generate a certificate run cd android && ./gradlew signingReport. This generates two variant keys. You have to copy both 'SHA1' and 'SHA-256' keys that belong to the 'debugAndroidTest' variant key option. Then, you can add those keys to the 'SHA certificate fingerprints' on your app in Firebase console.

to get SHA finger prints in terminal run this command in terminal
keytool -list -v -keystore ./android/App/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

you will get two keys 

Certificate fingerprints:
         SHA1: 5E:8F:16:06:2E:A3:CD:2C:4A:0D:54:78:76:BA:A6:F3:8C:AB:F6:25
         SHA256: FA:C6:17:45:DC:09:03:78:6F:B9:ED:E6:2A:96:2B:39:9F:73:48:F0:BB:6F:89:9B:83:32:66:75:91:03:3B:9C

         like this  you need it later so copy paste them in notepad .


step 3.-->  create a project in firebase console for android/ios/web . i am creating project  for android here

create an email for project :
 e.g -  dwork264@gmail.com

 >  now open firebase console . on nav bar click on        go to console
 >   now create a project  in fire base  console
 >  give a project name .

 >  you can enable or disable google analytics based on your requirement .iam disabling it cause im using for testing purpose .

 >  then click on create project  then project will be created then click continue.

 > click on icons provided below get started by add ing to your app. iam clicking on android because iam creating app for android.

 > now it will show a register app screen here you have to register your app.

 > on androoid package name  :  
   The "Android package name" must match your local project package name which can be found inside of the manifest tag within the /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file within your project.

 > give ant app nick name 

 >   now you need to give sha 1 : certificate there  
 > now click  on register app
  
  >  it will give you error  so provide some unique package name to avoid this error 

  > now click on next and next  don't download or make ant changes here.

  > now go to project settings go to your app and there add sha 256 finger print 

> after adding sha 256  fingerprint  now download google services .json file and place it in your projects's 
 android/app/ folder 
 e.g           ( /android/app/google-services.json ).

 now its time to do some changes in build.gradle file in both android and  app folder 

 > First, add the google-services plugin as a dependency inside of your /android/build.gradle file
 buildscript {
  dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.13'
    // Add me --- (add above classpath in dependencies)
  }
}

>   Lastly, execute the plugin by adding the following to your /android/app/build.gradle file:

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' // <- Add this line  on top og the grsdlefile.below apply plugin.


 now  create component directory and create file name authprovider
